## WHAT I DISCOVERED:
1. Sales Performance at a Glance:
- The company made about $1.3 billion in sales, selling 26,988 products, which averages 38 products per day.
- Electronics and groceries brought in the most revenue and had the highest sales volume, while clothing and
 furniture struggled in both areas.
2. Product Insights:
- Most products had a weak connection between how much was sold and the revenue they generated. Only
 two products (Product IDs 13 and 180) appeared in the top 10 for both sales and revenue.
- Stores matter: Higher sales volumes directly led to higher revenue. Stores like Cassandraton, Lisatown, and
 Lake Debra were the top performers.
3. Seasonal Trends:
- Busy Months: July and March saw the highest sales.
- Quiet Months: December and April were the slowest for sales.
4. Current Stock Levels:
- The company holds ₦1,232,359 in stock, with 501,517 units restocked and 26,988 units sold. After accounting
 for all movements, the total available stock is 1,706,888 units.
5. Efficiency Metrics:
- Sell-Out Rate: Only 2.19% of products in stock are being sold, a clear sign that inventory isn’t moving fast enough.
- Sell-Through Rate: At 1.58%, this is another indicator that products are sitting in stock far too long.
- Restock-to-Sales Ratio: At 18.58, this is far above the ideal ratio of 1, showing that the company is heavily
 overstocking.
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): At the current rate, it would take an eye-watering 46,296 days (that’s
 over 126 years!) to se l out a l the available stock. This highlights severe overstocking.
6. Stock Status by Store:
 - About 4,000 products are fully stocked, while 136 need restocking, and 1,000 are completely out of stock.


## RECOMMENDATIONS:  

**Sales Trend and Customer Shopping Habits**
- Investigate December 2023: Conduct research to understand what activities were done differently in December 2023 that led to changes in sales trends.
- Boost Sales in Peak Months: Increase marketing efforts in September, November, and December to take advantage of high sales periods. Make sure there is enough stock to meet increased demand during these peak months, especially for popular items like chairs, phones, binders, and papers.
- Engage the Consumer Segment: Use data to create personalized marketing campaigns for the consumer segment, which is the largest and most impactful group. Offer bundles that combine popular items like chairs and phones with office supplies to attract consumers.
  
**Product Performance and Profit Optimization**
- Improve Table Profitability: Find ways to reduce the procurement costs for tables to improve profit margins. Add features or create premium versions of tables to justify higher prices and increase profitability.
