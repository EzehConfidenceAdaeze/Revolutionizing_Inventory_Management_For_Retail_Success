# STRIKING THE BALANCE : REVOLUTIONIZING INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FOR RETAIL SUCCESS

## OBJECTIVES
 The goal of this project was to help a retail chain with multiple stores minimize
 stockouts and reduce overstocking. By analyzing their inventory and sales
 data, we aimed to find ways to improve efficiency and sales performance.

## WHAT I DISCOVERED:
**1. Sales Performance at a Glance:**
- The company made about $1.3 billion in sales, selling 26,988 products, which averages 38 products per day.
- Electronics and groceries brought in the most revenue and had the highest sales volume, while clothing and
 furniture struggled in both areas.
**2. Product Insights:**
- Most products had a weak connection between how much was sold and the revenue they generated. Only
 two products (Product IDs 13 and 180) appeared in the top 10 for both sales and revenue.
- Stores matter: Higher sales volumes directly led to higher revenue. Stores like Cassandraton, Lisatown, and
 Lake Debra were the top performers.
**3. Seasonal Trends:**
- Busy Months: July and March saw the highest sales.
- Quiet Months: December and April were the slowest for sales.
**4. Current Stock Levels:**
- The company holds ₦1,232,359 in stock, with 501,517 units restocked and 26,988 units sold. After accounting
 for all movements, the total available stock is 1,706,888 units.
**5. Efficiency Metrics:**
- Sell-Out Rate: Only 2.19% of products in stock are being sold, a clear sign that inventory isn’t moving fast enough.
- Sell-Through Rate: At 1.58%, this is another indicator that products are sitting in stock far too long.
- Restock-to-Sales Ratio: At 18.58, this is far above the ideal ratio of 1, showing that the company is heavily
 overstocking.
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): At the current rate, it would take an eye-watering 46,296 days (that’s
 over 126 years!) to se l out a l the available stock. This highlights severe overstocking.
**6. Stock Status by Store:**
 - About 4,000 products are fully stocked, while 136 need restocking, and 1,000 are completely out of stock.

## WHAT THIS MEANS
1. Overstocking is the biggest issue. Products are piling up in inventory faster
 than they’re being sold. This ties up cash and space unnecessarily.
2. Stockouts are rare but not fully eliminated. While only 1% of products are
 out of stock, it’s still something to monitor.
3. There’s untapped potential in optimizing sales by store. High-performing
 stores like Cassandraton and Lisatown offer clues to improve
 underperforming locations

## RECOMMENDATIONS:  

**1. Align Restocking with Demand:** Use demand forecasting to match
 restocking levels with actual sales. This will reduce excess stock and free
 up cash.
**2. Increase Product Turnover:** Launch sales, promotions, or discounts to move
 inventory faster, especially in slower categories like clothing and furniture.
**3. Learn from Top Performers:** Study why some stores and products
 outperform others, then replicate those strategies across the business.
**4. Focus on Efficiency Metrics:** Regularly track sell-through rate, stockout
 rate, restock-to-sales ratio, and DIO to keep inventory levels healthy
